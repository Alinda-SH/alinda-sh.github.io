                The purpose of this page is to create and maintain a clear overview of your study. This also shows to your student 
                career coach that you have some detailed knowledge where you can find relevant information and what your activities 
                in the coming year entail. The page contains at least the following parts: <br>

                The Study Monitor that shows the current status and progress of your study. <br>

                It is based on an html table (or better, for example the Bootstrap grid system). <br>
                All first-year test components (for which you received a grade) must be included. <br>
                 The test items must be grouped by block in order of time sequence. <br>
                A clear distinction must be made between parts that have not yet been completed, sufficient parts 
                (i.e. parts that have been obtained) and insufficient parts (still to be retaken). For example, by using 
                colours <br>

                It must be easy to add grades and credits obtained (later). <br>
                The “NBSA boundary” must be clearly visible.
                The Study Guide that contains a collection of relevant links (minimally 6). Think of: <br>
                    The HZ Course and Examination Regulations (CER) (see hz.nl> About HZ> Regulations & Documents> Course and Examination 
                    Regulations) <br>
                    The Implementation Regulations (IR) of the HBO-ICT programme (last year’s is also allowed) <br>
                    This Learn environment <br>
                    The Teams environment of the study programme <br>
                    The page in MyHZ with your study progress <br>
                    The Github environment of the study programme <br>
