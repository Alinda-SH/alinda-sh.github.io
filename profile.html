                <h2>My free time</h2>
                    <p> My biggest hobby is reading, I love to read books. My current favorite genres are young adult, fantasy and 
                        fanfiction. I can also appreciate a good psychological book. I don't have a number one favorite writer and 
                        I don't have a favorite book. There are too many books I love, to truly a favorite. 
                        <br>
                        My other hobbies are drawing, gardening and badminton.
