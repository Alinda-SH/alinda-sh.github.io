                        <p>
                        I am a first year student HBO-ICT at HZ Applied Science. <br>
                        My secundary school is Roncalli SG in Bergen op Zoom, Noord-Brabant. <br>
                        I have an atheneum diploma with as profile nature and technology and a certificate in Advanced English 
                        from Cambridge Assessment English, CEFR Level C1.<br>                
                        </p>

                <h2>My free time</h2> 
                    <p>
                        My biggest hobby is reading, I love to read books. My current favorite genres are young adult, fantasy, 
                        fanfiction and chinese novels (translated to English). I can also appreciate a good psychological book. I don't have a 
                        number one favorite writer and I don't have a favorite book. There are too many books I love, to truly a favorite. <br>
                        But if I have to name one, The Circle by Dave Eggers. Somehow, it is funny that this book is about technology and 
                        the way it influences us and our daily life.
                        <br>
                        My other hobbies are drawing, gardening and badminton. I like to draw, but I am bad at realistic drawing. 
                        I used to have a small piece of our yard, to grow vegatables. However I didn't have the time to tend my plants,
                        I was to busy with school and in the end I stopped. Now I have some flowers in garden and some potted plants in 
                        my room. They are two cacti and two succelents.<br> 
                        I play badminton. My club is Badminton Vereniging Dinteloord, we train and play each tuesday from 7 pm to max 10 pm.
                        I used to play matches, but my team disbanded, not enough members. <br>
