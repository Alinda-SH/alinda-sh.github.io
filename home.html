                The landing page of the site (index) is the page that the visitor arrives at when he enters the URL of your website 
                (without a specific .html file). This is often also referred to as the home or index page. <br>
                The purpose of this page is to give the audience your pitch in which you give your opinion why you think the HBO-ICT 
                programme and/or the ICT field suits you. As this page is only your own opinion, the content can never be wrong. At best 
                it can be incomplete. You are free in the way you want to demonstrate this. The challenge is to do it in an original way 
                and use the available technology (html/css) to show what you have learned in the past period. In any case, you must discuss 
                the following topics:<br>
                • The HBO level suits me because ...<br>
                • The study programme suits my personality because ...<br>
                The page contains minimally several images, links, texts, lists and/or tables.<br>
