            <h2>The HBO level suits me because ...</h2>
                <p>I didn't want to choose a study which was to theoretical. I have done atheneum, which gave me the oppertunity
                    to go to university. I have visited the TU Delft, but I found myself wondering, do I want to have to study
                    that much again. Aftwards I looked at some HBO, and realised the HBO level suited me more. <br>
                    I like the way HBO has more practical way of teaching, unlike university, which is more academic.

                it can be incomplete. You are free in the way you want to demonstrate this. The challenge is to do it in an original way 
                and use the available technology (html/css) to show what you have learned in the past period. In any case, you must discuss
