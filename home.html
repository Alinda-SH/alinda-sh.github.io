            <h2>The HBO level suits me because ...</h2>
                <p>I didn't want to choose a study which was to theoretical. I have done atheneum, which gave me the oppertunity
                    to go to university. I have visited the TU Delft, but I found myself wondering, do I want to have to study
                    that much again. Aftwards I looked at some HBO and realised the HBO level suited me more. <br>
                    I like the way HBO has more practical way of teaching, unlike university, which is more academic. It is more focussed 
                    on the near future, finding a job and give valuable experience.

            <h2>The study programme suits my personality because ...</h2>
                <p> I have found out I like to code something. I had the subject Informatics and it turned out, I liked to code.
                    Back then, I already knew I wanted to to something with technology. I visited the studies electrical engineering and
                    mechanical engineering, and later the studies informatics and technical informatics, all HBOs. <br>
                    To be honest, I hadn't planned to visit this study, I went to visit watermanagment and happend to stumble upon this 
                    study. In the end I chose this study. <br>
                    This study programme suits my personality because the working method, agile, is focussed on feedback, learning from
                    the feedback and striving to be better. I know it is impossible to be good at something immediately, you have to learn
                    and sometimes you have to fail to become better. Agile working accepts that things can go wrong, but is focussed on
                    improving.
