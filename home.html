            <h2>The HBO level suits me because ...</h2>
                <p>I didn't want to choose a study which was to theoretical. I have done atheneum, which gave me the oppertunity
                    to go to university. I have visited the TU Delft, but I found myself wondering, do I want to have to study
                    that much again. Aftwards I looked at some HBO and realised the HBO level suited me more. <br>
                    I like the way HBO has more practical way of teaching, unlike university, which is more academic. It is more focussed 
                    on the near future, finding a job and give valuable experience.
