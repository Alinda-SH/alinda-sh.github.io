                What is Motivation ? </br>
 
                 Motivation is the word derived from the word ’motive’ which means needs, desires, wants or drives within 
                 the individuals. It is the process of stimulating people to actions to accomplish the goals. In the work 
                 goal context the psychological factors stimulating the people’s behaviour can be </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> desire for money </li>
                    <li> success </li>
                    <li> recognition </li>
                    <li> job-satisfaction</li>
                    <li> team work </li>
                    <li> etc </li>
                </ul>
               
                <p>
                One of the most important functions of management is to create willingness amongst the employees to perform 
                in the best of their abilities. Therefore the role of a leader is to arouse interest in performance of employees 
                in their jobs. The process of motivation consists of three stages: </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>A felt need or drive </li>
                    <li>A stimulus in which needs have to be aroused </li>
                    <li>When needs are satisfied, the satisfaction or accomplishment of goals. </li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>
                Therefore, we can say that motivation is a psychological phenomenon which means needs and wants of the individuals 
                have to be tackled by framing an incentive plan. </p>
