                <p>
                I’m reasonably intrinsically motivated and I’m are reasonably motivated extrinsically.  The fact that you are 
                reasonably intrinsically motivated means that you really enjoy studying.  But you don't really like it either.  
                The fact that you are motivated to a reasonable degree means that you also take into account what you can achieve 
                with your studies: a diploma, money, status or the recognition of the people you love.  In itself there is nothing 
                wrong with your motivation.  You would be happier if your studies were more in line with your true interests.

            <h2>Assignment 4: <a href="https://www.123test.nl/schein/">Career anchor</a> </h2>
                <p>
                    Most points you gave to the role: Creativity (21 points) </br>
                    For someone who has creativity as a career anchor, producing new ideas or products is the primary goal.  
                    The motive is to be innovative.  A working environment that is procedural and leaves little room for personal 
                    initiative can be experienced as very restrictive.  Creative people often prefer to work independently or in small teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then you indicated the most points: Independence (15 points) </br>
                    Autonomy is an important driver.  People with this career anchor are all about independence and being 
                    able to make their own decisions.  It is therefore not surprising that these people are often their own 
                    boss or would like to become one.  They are therefore guided in their career choice by the question to what 
                    extent they can go their own way or work independently.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    The least number of points you gave for: Wealth (6 points) </br>
                    Wealth as a career anchor says something about the importance one places on material reward.  Earning money 
                    is often the most important reason to work.  A high income and earning more is the motivation for these people 
                    to make career choices.  A high or higher income is an important measure of success for this person.

                    According to author and speaker Kendra Cherry (Cherry, What is motivation?, 2020) is motivation a process that 
                    initiates, guides and maintains goal-oriented behaviours. It is what causes you to act, whether it is getting 
                    a glass of water to reduce thirst or reading a book to gain knowledge. </br>
                    Motivation involves the emotional, biological, cognitive, and social forces that initiate and activate behaviour. 
                    In everyday practise, the term “motivation” is often used to describe why a person does something. </br>
                    Cherry claims motivation doesn’t only refer to the factors that activate behaviour, it also involves the aspects 
                    that direct and maintain these goal-directed actions, though such causes are rarely directly observable). As an 
                    outcome, we frequently have to infer the reasons why people do things they do based on observable behaviours.
